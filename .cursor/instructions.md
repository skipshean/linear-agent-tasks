# Cursor Instructions

## Project Purpose
This repository helps identify and manage Linear tasks that can be automated or assisted by AI agents.

## Key Tasks
1. Analyze Linear issues to identify agent-suitable tasks
2. Detect and mark duplicate issues from Fireflies integration
3. Create execution plans for agent automation
4. Document findings and recommendations

## Important Notes
- Be mindful of Linear API rate limits (1500 requests/hour)
- Mark duplicates in a reversible way (using labels or comments)
- Focus on tasks with clear requirements and acceptance criteria
- Don't execute tasks automatically - this is a planning repository
